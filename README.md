# Assignment: Build a Sign Up Form

### Objective:
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items youâ€™ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time itâ€™s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

### Task:

- Download a full-resolution copy of the design file, and get a general idea for how youâ€™re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document and build it
- The design has a large background-image, so go find and download an image you want to use for that section.
- Pick an external font for the â€˜logoâ€™ section
- For the image-sidebar, weâ€™ve used this Odin logo. Again, feel free to replace it.
